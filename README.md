# DRF Django

DRF Django is a Django application that provides a set of utilities and enhancements for building APIs using Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF). It aims to simplify the process of building robust and scalable APIs by providing commonly used functionalities out of the box.

## Features

DRF Django comes with the following features:

1. **Custom API views**: It provides custom API views that extend the functionality of DRF views, making it easier to implement common patterns such as search, filtering, pagination, and more.

2. **Enhanced serializers**: DRF Django includes enhanced serializers that add additional functionality to the standard DRF serializers. This includes features like field-level validation, advanced serialization options, and more.

3. **Flexible authentication**: It provides an authentication framework that allows you to easily configure and customize authentication methods for your API endpoints. It supports token-based authentication, session-based authentication, and more.

4. **Rate limiting**: DRF Django includes rate limiting capabilities to protect your API from abuse and ensure fair usage. It allows you to define rate limits based on various criteria, such as IP address, user, or specific API endpoints.

5. **Bulk operations**: It provides support for bulk operations, allowing you to perform multiple CRUD operations in a single API request. This can greatly improve performance and reduce network overhead when working with large datasets.

6. **Utilities and mixins**: DRF Django includes a collection of utilities and mixins that can be used to extend the functionality of your API views and serializers. These utilities provide common functionalities such as caching, pagination, filtering, and more.
